<p>'The Stables' is a semi-detached cottage with lovely views across the wooded valley. Tastefully converted, the cottage combines character and charm with the best of modern comfort. 'The Stables' is an ideal holiday base for families, walkers and nature lovers. Children love exploring the orchards, woods and stream (all tucked well away from the road) and eco-friendly farm practices mean the fifty-acre holding boasts a huge variety of butterflies, birds and wildflowers. Adults may like to try their hand at the occasional painting lessons available in the purpose built studio - Colin and Tina are established artists who offer tuition (depending on availability) for all ages and standards.</p>
