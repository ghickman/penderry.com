      <p class="intro">
        Having spent years holidaying in Pembrokeshire, many of them at
        Penderry, Colin and Tina (and their expanding family of children and
        animals) finally moved here 28 years ago.  Penderry, a traditional
        Welsh farm house with two cottages attached, lies in a unique patch
        of countryside - seemingly isolated in the beautiful Lampeter Vale,
        yet only 10 minutes drive from the bustling little town of Narberth.
        From the meandering river Cwm in the valley to the panoramic hilltop
        views, Penderry is surrounded by 50 acres of woodland and meadows.
        The unspoilt farmland boasts an amazing variety of wildlife, flowers,
        butterflies and birds, as well as the domestic pets, sheep and
        chickens on the smallholding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Penderry is surrounded by fifty acres of woodland, meadows, ponds and a
        river, and is home to an amazing variety of wildlife, including otters, foxes
        and badgers. Over fifty species of birds have been sighted at Penderry,
        including red kites, kingfishers and barn owls.
      </p>

        The mixed deciduous woodland has two sites used by many children for Forest
        Schools. Children from local primary schools come to play, broaden their
        knowledge, develop confidence and learn to value the countryside. The
        Chernobyl Children Lifeline also use the woodland as part of their respite
        holidays for Belarusian children. The Cwm Wood at Penderry was runner-up in
        the Woods for Wales Award (2007), and won a special award for educational and
        community use of the woodland.

      <p>
        We farm Penderry as it was probably farmed 100 years ago, aiming to minimise
        our impact on the environment. We cut our hay late in the year, which allows
        many species of wildflowers to flourish, and in turn encourages moths and
        butterflies, providing a source of food for a variety of birds.

        The river Cwm meanders along the picturesque valley. In the late autumn,
        trout can be seen leaping up the small waterfall to go upstream to spawn.

      <p class="intro">
        Penderry is ideally situated as a base to explore Pembrokeshire from,
        whilst enjoying the tranquility of the countryside.  The lively little

        minutes drive away.
      </p>

      <h2>Beaches</h2>

        Pembrokeshire has more Blue Flag beaches and Seaside Awards than any
