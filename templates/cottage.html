<h1>The Cottage</h1>
<p class="intro">
  The Stables is a semi-detached cottage with lovely views across the wooded
  valley. Tastefully converted, the cottage combines character and charm with
  the best of modern comfort. 'The Stables' is an ideal holiday base for
  families, walkers and nature lovers. Children love exploring the orchards,
  woods and stream (all tucked well away from the road) and eco-friendly farm
  practices mean the fifty-acre holding boasts a huge variety of butterflies,
  birds and wildflowers. Adults may like to try their hand at the occasional
  painting lessons available in the purpose built studio - Colin and Tina are
  established artists who offer tuition for all ages and standards.
