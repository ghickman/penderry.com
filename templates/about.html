<h1>About Penderry</h1>
<p class="f4">
  Having spent years holidaying in Pembrokeshire, many of them at Penderry,
  Colin and Tina (and their expanding family of children and animals) finally
  moved here 20 years ago. Penderry, a traditional Welsh farm house with two
  cottages attached, lies in a unique patch of countryside - seemingly isolated
  in the beautiful Lampeter Vale, yet only 10 minutes drive from the bustling
  little town of Narberth. From the meandering river Cwm in the valley to the
  panoramic hilltop views, Penderry is surrounded by 50 acres of woodland and
  meadows. The unspoilt farmland boasts an amazing variety of wildlife,
  flowers, butterflies and birds, as well as the domestic pets, sheep and
  chickens on the smallholding.

  Penderry is surrounded by fifty acres of woodland, meadows, ponds and a
  river, and is home to an amazing variety of wildlife, including otters, foxes
  and badgers. Over fifty species of birds have been sighted at Penderry,
  including red kites, kingfishers and barn owls.

  The mixed deciduous woodland has two sites used by many children for Forest
  Schools. Children from local primary schools come to play, broaden their
  knowledge, develop confidence and learn to value the countryside. The
  Chernobyl Children Lifeline also use the woodland as part of their respite
  holidays for Belarusian children. The Cwm Wood at Penderry was runner-up in
  the Woods for Wales Award (2007), and won a special award for educational and
  community use of the woodland.

  We farm Penderry as it was probably farmed 100 years ago, aiming to minimise
  our impact on the environment. We cut our hay late in the year, which allows
  many species of wildflowers to flourish, and in turn encourages moths and
  butterflies, providing a source of food for a variety of birds.

  The river Cwm meanders along the picturesque valley. In the late autumn,
  trout can be seen leaping up the small waterfall to go upstream to spawn.
