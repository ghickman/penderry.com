%p'The Dairy' and 'The Stables' are two pretty cottages adjoining Penderry, set in a tranquil 50 acre smallholding just six miles from Amroth beach. Tastefully converted, the cottages combine character and charm with the best of modern comfort. There is a small front garden for each property, but visitors are welcome to explore the whole farm and to enjoy the gardens, fields and woodland. There is a variety of seating and tables for eating out and children often like to feed the ducks and hens in the orchard. Adults may prefer to try their hand at the occasional painting lessons available in the purpose built studio - Colin and Tina are established artists who offer tuition (depending on availability) for all ages and standards.
