%p &apos;The Dairy&apos; and &apos;The Stables&apos; are semi-detached character cottages flanking  Penderry, with lovely views across the wooded valley. Tastefully converted, the cottages combine character and charm with the best of modern comfort. &apos;The Dairy&apos; and &apos;The Stables&apos; are an ideal holiday base for families, walkers and nature lovers. Children love exploring the orchards, woods and stream (all tucked well away from the road) and eco-friendly farm practices mean the fifty-acre holding boasts a huge variety of butterflies, birds and wildflowers. Adults may like to try their hand at the occasional painting lessons available in the purpose built studio - Colin and Tina are established artists who offer tuition (depending on availability) for all ages and standards.
